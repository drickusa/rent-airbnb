# Rent-Airbnb Data Pipeline Overview

The Rent-Airbnb pipeline solution was implemented to load and transform data from two sources, enabling better insights into the rental property and Airbnb markets. The goal is to support potential investors in identifying the most attractive properties to purchase.

The solution follows the Medallion Architecture, and each section of the README explains the rationale behind the design decisions, as well as providing an overview of how the solution was implemented.

## Architecture Overview

This pipeline implements a three-layer data lakehouse architecture in **Unity Catalog** (`rentalproperty` catalog) using Delta Lake tables. Each layer serves a distinct purpose in the data quality and transformation journey.

## 🥉 Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion

**Notebook:** `001_bronze_ingest`

**Purpose:** Capture raw data exactly as it arrives from the two manual source files with minimal transformation. 

**Why Bronze?**
* **Data lineage** — Preserve original data for auditing and reprocessing
* **Recovery** — Reprocess downstream layers without re-ingesting from external sources
* **Schema evolution** — Store raw data before understanding all business rules

**Tables:**
* `rentalproperty.bronze.airbnb` — Raw Airbnb listings (CSV)
* `rentalproperty.bronze.rentals` — Raw rental listings (JSON)

**Key Characteristics:**
* Minimal transformation (type inference only)
* Includes ingestion timestamp (`ingestedDateTime`)
* Overwrite mode (full refresh pattern)
* Preserves all source columns unchanged

## 🥈 Silver Layer: Cleaned & Standardized Data

**Notebooks:** `002_silver_load_airbnb`, `003_silver_load_rentals`

**Purpose:** Transform raw data into **clean, conformed, and enriched** datasets ready for business use. The silver layer applies data quality rules, standardizes formats, and adds business keys.

**Why Silver?**
* **Data quality** — Remove duplicates, handle nulls, validate formats
* **Standardization** — Normalize naming conventions (camelCase), date formats, postal codes
* **Consistency** — Apply uniform business rules across all datasets
* **Performance** — Optimized schema and types for downstream queries
* **Reusability** — Single source of clean data for multiple use cases
* **Enrichment** — Add derived columns and business keys without changing bronze

**Tables:**
* `rentalproperty.silver.airbnb`
* `rentalproperty.silver.rentals`

**Key Transformations:**
* **Deduplication** — Remove duplicate records
* **Type casting** — Convert strings to proper types (int, double, timestamp)
* **Postal code validation** — Normalize Dutch postal codes to `1234 AB` format
* **Currency parsing** — Clean currency fields, handle NA/None/null values
* **Date parsing** — Extract structured dates from free-text availability fields
* **Primary key generation** — Create `listingPk` via MD5 hash of coordinates
* **Audit columns** — Add `insertedDatetime`, `updatedDatetime`, `source`
* **Column renaming** — Standardize to camelCase with descriptive names
* **Drop obsolete columns** — Remove crawl metadata not needed for analytics

## 🥇 Gold Layer: Business-Level Aggregates

**Notebook:** `004_gold_load_revenue`

**Purpose:** Create **aggregated, business-specific datasets** optimized for reporting, dashboards, and analytics. In the Gold layer, only simple aggregations were performed. The investors can leverage this curated dataset to develop more advanced queries and conduct deeper analysis of the rental and Airbnb markets.

**Why Gold?**
* **Performance** — Pre-aggregated data for quicker analysis
* **Simplicity** — Business users query simple tables, not complex joins
* **Consistency** — Metrics calculated once, used everywhere (single version of truth)
* **Cost optimization** — Avoid repeated expensive aggregations
* **Business alignment** — Tables map directly to business KPIs and reports

**Tables:**
* `rentalproperty.gold.airbnb_per_listing` — Total revenue by listing
* `rentalproperty.gold.airbnb_per_postalcode` — Total revenue by postal code (Airbnb)
* `rentalproperty.gold.rental_per_listing` — Total revenue by rental listing
* `rentalproperty.gold.rental_per_postalcode` — Total revenue by postal code (rentals)

**Key Aggregations:**
* Revenue summaries grouped by listing or postal code
* Includes geographic coordinates for geospatial analysis
* Audit columns for tracking data freshness
* Optimized for BI tool consumption

## Pipeline Orchestration

**Notebook:** `005_runnable`

Executes the full ETL pipeline sequentially:
1. Bronze ingestion
2. Silver transformation (Airbnb + Rentals)
3. Gold aggregation

Uses `dbutils.notebook.run()` to orchestrate the pipeline with proper error handling and logging.

## Benefits of Medallion Architecture

1. **Separation of concerns** — Each layer has a single, well-defined purpose
2. **Incremental complexity** — Transformations become more sophisticated layer-by-layer
3. **Flexible reprocessing** — Rebuild silver/gold without re-ingesting bronze
4. **Performance optimization** — Each layer optimized for its access pattern
5. **Data governance** — Clear boundaries for data quality rules and ownership
6. **Schema evolution** — Changes isolated to specific layers
7. **Cost efficiency** — Reduce redundant processing via pre-aggregation

---

## Future Enhancements

* Implement **SCD Type 1** or **Type 2** for tracking historical changes and to have a backfill operation after receiving improved source data
* Switch from overwrite to **incremental merge** patterns
* Add **automated testing** for transformation logic
* Deploy to production using **Declarative Automation Bundles (DABs)** and **Workflow Jobs** for enterprise-grade orchestration, version control, and CI/CD integration

## Known Limitations

* **Parquet export not functional on Databricks Free Edition** — Export to Parquet format (notebook `9999_ExportData`) encounters permission errors due to DBFS root restrictions in the free tier. Code is available for reference but requires a paid Databricks workspace with Unity Catalog Volumes for execution.
